How to build a factory in 4 weeks

Executive summary:
1) Background
The COVID19 has pointed out the need in hydroalcoholic gel, medical masks and specific hospitals.
The difficulty was the lack of factory to support needs.
In the futur this kind of situation will come back whatever the reasons (starving, pollution, epidemics,natural disasters,..)

2) Key points
Build factory or increase the mass production at short term was quite impossible due to many reasons.
The difficulty was not technical but mainly a logistic issue. How to supply materials, human ressources, facilities, organisation and building without adhoc project management.
Thus the present study will consist to find solutions to anticipate before the disasters.

3) The proposal
Our proposal is to build a quick factory project management with an opensource project on Github.
The solutions are based on anticipation. It is a 
The targets would be :

T1: propose logical schemes to analyse and find the best orgnisation versus the needs 
T2: propose a  task force organisation
T3: propose a project management 
T4: identify key ressources to be managed and anticipate solutions to be standardized.
T5: propose a test case for training
